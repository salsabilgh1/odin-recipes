      <h4>Description</h4>
      <p>Pizza is a beloved Italian dish consisting of a flatbread crust topped with tomato sauce, cheese (often mozzarella), and various toppings like pepperoni, mushrooms, or vegetables. The dough is rolled out, topped with ingredients, and baked at a high temperature until the crust is crisp and the cheese is melted and bubbly. Regional variations exist, such as thin-crust Neapolitan or deep-dish Chicago-style pizza.</p>
